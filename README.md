Dotenv loads environment variables from `.env` into `ENV` (process.env for default).

## Install

```bash
npm install dotenv --save
```

## Usage

As early as possible in your application, require and load dotenv.

```javascript
require('dotenv').load();
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add
environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`.
For example:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=s1mpl3
```

That's it.

`process.env` now has the keys and values you defined in your `.env` file.

```javascript
db.connect({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  username: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASS
});
```

### Preload

If you are using iojs-v1.6.0 or later, you can use the `--require` (`-r`) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.


```bash
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
```

The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format `dotenv_config_<option>=value`

```bash
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/your/env/vars
```

## Config

`config` will read your .env file, parse the contents, and assign it to
`process.env` - just like `load` does. You can additionally, pass options to
`config`.

Note: `config` and `load` are synonyms. You can pass options to either.

### Options

#### Silent

Default: `false`

Dotenv outputs a warning to your console if missing a `.env` file. Suppress
this warning using silent.

```js
require('dotenv').config({silent: true});
```

#### Path

Default: `.env`

You can specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is
named or located differently.

```js
require('dotenv').config({path: '/custom/path/to/your/env/vars'});
```

#### Encoding

Default: `utf8`

You may specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables
using this option.

```js
require('dotenv').config({encoding: 'base64'});
```

#### Returns

Default: `Boolean`

You may specify the returns using `Boolean` which extends environment to
`process.env` or use `Object` which returns you object with environment values.

## Parse

The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.

```js
var dotenv  = require('dotenv');
var buf    = new Buffer('BASIC=basic');
var config  = dotenv.parse(buf); // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
```

### Rules

The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

- `BASIC=basic` becomes `{BASIC: 'basic'}`
- empty lines are skipped
- lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments
- empty values become empty strings (`EMPTY=` becomes `{EMPTY: ''}`)
- single and double quoted values are escaped (`SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted'` becomes `{SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"}`)
- new lines are expanded if in double quotes (`MULTILINE="new\nline"` becomes

```
{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}
```
- inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (`JSON={"foo": "bar"}` becomes `{JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"`)

#### Expanding Variables

Basic variable expansion is supported.

```
BASIC=basic
TEST=$BASIC
```

Parsing that would result in `{BASIC: 'basic', TEST: 'basic'}`. You can escape
variables by quoting or beginning with `\` (e.g. `TEST=\$BASIC`). If the
variable is not found in the file, `process.env` is checked. Missing variables
result in an empty string.

```
BASIC=basic
TEST=$TEST
DNE=$DNE
```

```bash
TEST=example node -e 'require("dotenv").config();'
```

- `process.env.BASIC` would equal `basic`
- `process.env.TEST` would equal `example`
- `process.env.DNE` would equal `""`

## FAQ

### Should I commit my `.env` file?

No. We **strongly** recommend against committing your `.env` file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.

### Should I have multiple `.env` files?

No. We **strongly** recommend against having a "main" `.env` file and an "environment" `.env` file like `.env.test`. Your config should vary between deploys, and you should not be sharing values between environments.

> In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as “environments”, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
