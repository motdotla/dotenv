      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Web Incubator Community Group (WICG) provides a lightweight venue for
      proposing and discussing new web platform features. Each proposal will be
      discussed in its own repository within the group's Github account.
      Membership of the group is open to everybody but all participants will
      have signed the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As proposals gain support and become more stable and mature they will be
      considered for migration to a W3C Working Group where they can be put on
      the Recommendation track with appropriate status and Intellectual
      Property (IP) considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individuals, after consultation with the <a href="#chairs">Chairs</a>,
      may prepare an "<a href=
      "https://github.com/WICG/admin/blob/gh-pages/intent-to-migrate.md">intent
      to migrate</a>" assessment, outlining use cases, as well as
      implementation considerations, security, privacy, accessibility, and
      internationalization impacts. Those requests are evaluated within the
      Community Group as well as the targeted W3C Working Group, if any. The
      role of the CG and WG <a href="#chairs">Chairs</a> and W3C team is to
      facilitate the migration and ensure proper continuity in the community
      who proposed the idea.
    </p>
    <h2 id="background">
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      W3C Community Groups provide a convenient structure within which to
      discuss early standards proposals with a concrete contribution license.
      While they are relatively simple to create, there is still enough
      friction in the system that causes some people to start work outside W3C
      with no formal IP considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the WICG is to balance these two considerations. It should be
      as low friction as possible to make new proposals where participants make
      their contributions with known IP commitments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, the WICG will grow into a large community of people that have
      signed up for their contributions to be made according to the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C CG CLA</a>, much
      like an open source project grows a list of contributors making pull
      requests under the project license. The agreement only has to be accepted
      once and then contributions to any proposal in the CG are covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different organisations will have different internal policies for
      managing engagement in the WICG. Some will run internal processes before
      allowing their representatives to engage and make contributions to a
      particular proposal. Others allow contributions to any proposal according
      to standing policies. It is up to each organisation to determine how to
      manage this.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach provides the following benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoids web standards proposals scattered in random personal GitHub
      repos that have unknown IP status.
      </li>
      <li>Avoids spending months in charter discussions before commencing work
      in a WG or even the overhead of finding the right people to begin a new
      Community Group.
      </li>
      <li>Encourages new people (especially web developers) to make proposals
      without having to first understand how to navigate the role and scope of
      different W3C Working Groups.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="scope">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Community Group will accept and discuss any proposal for a web
      platform feature that would be implemented in a browser or similar user
      agent. Any suggestions, pull requests, issues, or comments made about a
      proposal fall under the CLA. Editors of feature proposals must ensure
      that no contributions are adopted from anyone who is not a member of the
      Community Group.
    </p>
    <h2 id="nonscope">
      Out of Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      Features or ideas that don't have applicability in a browser (or similar
      user agent) should be proposed to another Community Group.
    </p>
    <h2 id="proposals">
      Current Proposals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group publishes an <a href=
      "https://github.com/WICG/admin/blob/gh-pages/README.md#current-proposals">
      index of the proposals</a> worked on in GitHub. Any <a href=
      "https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/building-polyfills/9781449370725/ch07.html">
      speculative polyfills</a> (sometimes called "prollyfills") or test suites
      will be developed in Open Source using the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      New projects or status changes are communicated to the group through the
      public announcement mailing list (this list will not be used for
      discussing proposals).
    </p>
    <p>
      Proposal editors should publish regular status updates to the
      announcement mailing list (again encouraging discussion in the GitHub
      repo). This allows group participants to monitor progress without having
      to directly watch every repo.
    </p>
    <h2 id="liaisons">
      Dependencies or Liaisons
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is anticipated that the group will collaborate with appropriate W3C
      Working Groups and WHATWG Workstreams in order to transition spec
      proposals to the Recommendation or Living Standard track. The following
      groups are the most likely to adopt proposals from this group:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href=
        "https://github.com/whatwg/sg/blob/master/Workstreams.md#html">HTML</a>
        and <a href=
        "https://github.com/whatwg/sg/blob/master/Workstreams.md#dom">DOM</a>
        Workstream
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webappswg/">Web Applications Working
        Group</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS Working Group</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">Device APIs Working Group</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process and Patent Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms of in this charter that conflict with those of
      the Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a> (Proposals in this Community
      Group charter are applicable "Specification" in the CLA). When people
      request to participate without representing their organization’s legal
      interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with
      the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual’s first request to
      make a contribution to a group deliverable. The section on <a href=
      "#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes how W3C expects to
      monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make contributions in the GitHub
      repo for the project that they are interested in. This may be in the form
      of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by adding a
      comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group mailing list must not be used for discussing details
      of specific projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created for proposals in the Community Group must use the
      <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>
      and <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a>
      files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: this CG will not use a <em>contrib</em> mailing list for
      contributions since all contributions will be tracked via Github
      mechanisms (e.g. pull requests).
    </p>
    <h2 id="chair_selection">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <dfn id="chairs">Chairs</dfn> are <a href=
      "mailto:cwilso@google.com">Chris Wilson</a>, <a href=
      "mailto:yoavweiss@google.com">Yoav Weiss</a>, <a href=
      "mailto:Travis.Leithead@microsoft.com">Travis Leithead</a>, and <a href=
	  "mailto:lwatson@tetralogical.com">Léonie Watson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their <a>Chair(s)</a> and can replace
      their <a>Chair(s)</a>at any time using whatever means they prefer.
      However, if 5 participants —no two from the same organization— call for
      an election, the group must use the following process to replace any
      current <a>Chair(s)</a> with a new Chair, consulting the Community
      Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and
      using RFC 2777).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes —no two from the same
      organization— is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to the Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Charter can be amended by the <a href="#chairs">Chairs</a> with
      consultation of the Community Group, if the change is agreed to by W3C's
      Community Development Lead (Community Development Lead is described in
      the CG Process).
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. The
      editors of a spec will determine and record consensus decisions through
      the spec's GitHub repo issue list with assistance from the CG <a href=
      "#chairs">Chairs</a>. Members of the group may reopen issues with new
      technical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the <a href="#chairs">Chairs</a>' responsibility to ensure that the
      decision process is fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not
      unreasonably favour or discriminate against any group participant or
      their employer. With that said, the group favours forward motion and
      dissent will not be allowed to block work on a spec.
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided), the
      Committers will continue with their preference. The issue should be
      recorded as decided without consensus. Individuals who disagree with the
      Committer's choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their
      objection by taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly
      allowed (and preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting
      implementation experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the
      group to move ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, only the Editor's are the only Committers. It is expected that
      participants can earn Committer status in a GitHub repo through a history
      of valuable contributions as is common in open source projects.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work on its GitHub
      repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure
      contributions can be tracked and to ensure that engagement will scale to
      a large number of proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in the repo issues list. Any group participant may object to a decision
      reached at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of
      the decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The <a href="#chairs">Chairs</a> will facilitate discussion to
      try to resolve the objection according to the <a href=
      "#decision">decision process</a>.
